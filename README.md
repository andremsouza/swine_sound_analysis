# Feature extraction and mining for exploratory analysis of biological audio data

This repository contains the source code for my final undergraduate project in the second semester of 2020. I studied methods for preprocessing, extracting features, and applying data visualization techniques with audio data. I utilized Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) for dimensionality reduction and got potential insights from the data. I am continuing this research as part of my master’s degree dissertation.

## Abstract

This project studied methods for preprocessing, extracting features, and applied data visualization techniques with audio data. The main goal was to analyze, in an exploratory approach, a dataset of audio segments from finishing pigs, focusing on identifying behavioral patterns caused by the Ractopamine hydrochloride (RAC) food additive. The research data was provided by the School of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science (FMVZ-USP). We studied various features from the audio signals and analyzed their distribution using data visualization methods. Furthermore, we utilized Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) for dimensionality reduction and got potential insights from the data. By analyzing the distributions of a subset of our features, the results showed a relationship between RAC provision and an increase in vocalization from the animals, asides from the SOM providing useful insights on the differences between recording devices. Finally, the insights provided by this project may be used in future research projects on sound analysis of animal bio-signals.
